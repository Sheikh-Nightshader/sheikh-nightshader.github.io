    <h1>General Online Safety</h1>
    <a href="hub.html" class="button">Back</a>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Protect Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>Be mindful of the personal information you share online. Avoid posting sensitive details such as your full name, address, phone number, or financial information on public platforms.</p>
        <p>Always question the necessity of sharing such data. Consider using pseudonyms or limiting details on profiles to enhance privacy. Additionally, review the privacy policies of websites and applications to understand how your data is being used.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Use Strong, Unique Passwords</h2>
        <p>Create strong passwords that are unique to each account. A strong password typically includes a mix of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters. Aim for a minimum of 12 characters.</p>
        <p>Consider using a password manager to store and generate passwords securely, ensuring you never reuse passwords across different accounts. Avoid using easily guessable information such as birthdays or common words.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
        <p>Enable 2FA on all accounts that support it. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step, such as a text message code, in addition to your password.</p>
        <p>Using authentication apps instead of SMS for 2FA can further enhance security, as they are less vulnerable to interception. Some popular apps include Google Authenticator and Authy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Be Cautious with Public Wi-Fi</h2>
        <p>Public Wi-Fi networks can be insecure, making it easier for attackers to intercept your data. Avoid accessing sensitive information or logging into important accounts while connected to public networks.</p>
        <p>Whenever possible, use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for an added layer of security, which encrypts your internet traffic, shielding it from prying eyes. This is especially important when conducting transactions or sharing sensitive information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Understand the Use of Proxies</h2>
        <p>Proxies act as intermediaries between your device and the internet. They can help mask your IP address and allow you to browse anonymously. While proxies can offer some level of privacy, they do not encrypt your traffic, making them less secure than VPNs.</p>
        <p>Use proxies with caution, especially free ones, as they may log your activity or inject ads into your browsing session. If privacy is a priority, consider using a reputable VPN service instead.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Recognize Phishing Attempts</h2>
        <p>Be wary of emails, messages, or links from unknown sources. Phishing attempts often look legitimate, but they can lead to identity theft or malware infections.</p>
        <p><span class="important">Always verify the sender</span> and be cautious before clicking on links or downloading attachments. Look for signs such as misspelled words or suspicious URLs. Using email filtering services can help catch phishing attempts before they reach your inbox.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Keep Software Up to Date</h2>
        <p>Regularly update your operating system, applications, and security software to protect against vulnerabilities. Updates often include security patches that address newly discovered threats.</p>
        <p>Enable automatic updates whenever possible to ensure youâ€™re always protected against the latest vulnerabilities. Regularly check for updates on apps that may not have automatic updates enabled.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>8. Use Secure Connections</h2>
        <p>Ensure that websites use HTTPS, which encrypts data transmitted between your browser and the server. Look for a padlock icon in the address bar to confirm that a site is secure before entering sensitive information.</p>
        <p>Avoid entering personal details on websites that do not use HTTPS, especially for transactions and logins. Consider using browser extensions that enforce HTTPS connections whenever possible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>9. Monitor Your Accounts Regularly</h2>
        <p>Check your bank and online accounts frequently for any suspicious activity. If you notice anything unusual, report it immediately and change your passwords.</p>
        <p>Set up alerts for account activity, so you're notified of any transactions or changes made to your accounts. Additionally, consider using credit monitoring services to stay aware of your financial status.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>10. Be Mindful of Social Media Privacy</h2>
        <p>Review your social media privacy settings to control who can see your posts and personal information. Limit sharing to friends and family, and avoid public sharing of sensitive information.</p>
        <p>Consider making your profiles private to restrict access to your information, and regularly review your friend list to ensure only trusted contacts are connected. Be cautious of friend requests from unknown individuals.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>11. Educate Yourself and Others</h2>
        <p>Stay informed about the latest online threats and best practices for staying safe. Share this knowledge with family and friends to help create a safer online environment for everyone.</p>
        <p>Participate in online safety workshops or webinars to further enhance your understanding of cybersecurity. Encourage your friends and family to practice good online safety habits as well.</p>
