    <h1>Dangers of Public Wi-Fi</h1>

     <a href="index.html" class="button">Back</a>

    <h2>1. Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</h2>
    <p>Attackers can intercept communication between your device and the Wi-Fi network. This allows them to capture sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and private messages without you knowing. They can also manipulate your data, potentially leading to identity theft or financial loss.</p>

    <h2>2. Unencrypted Networks</h2>
    <p>Many public Wi-Fi networks lack encryption. Without encryption, any data you send over the network can be easily accessed and read by anyone else connected to the same network. Attackers can use packet sniffing tools to capture unencrypted traffic and glean sensitive information.</p>

    <h2>3. Rogue Hotspots</h2>
    <p>Cybercriminals often set up fake Wi-Fi hotspots with names similar to legitimate networks. If you connect to one of these rogue hotspots, the attacker can monitor your activity, intercept your data, and inject malware into your device. They can also redirect you to phishing sites to steal your credentials.</p>

    <h2>4. Malware Distribution</h2>
    <p>Public Wi-Fi networks can be a breeding ground for malware. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in connected devices to push malware like viruses, spyware, or ransomware, which can infect your device and steal your data. Malware can also be used to create a backdoor into your system for future attacks.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Snooping</h2>
    <p>With special tools, hackers can "sniff" the traffic on public Wi-Fi networks. This allows them to capture any unencrypted data you send, including login credentials, personal information, and sensitive emails. Even if you think your connection is secure, data snooping can compromise your privacy.</p>

    <h2>6. Session Hijacking</h2>
    <p>If you’re logged into accounts such as email or banking while on public Wi-Fi, attackers can hijack your session. This can give them unauthorized access to your accounts, allowing them to perform transactions or change account settings without your knowledge. They can also access private information and impersonate you online.</p>

    <h2>7. Privacy Risks</h2>
    <p>Public Wi-Fi often lacks the privacy safeguards of a secure network. Your browsing habits, personal information, and even location can be tracked and misused by cybercriminals or third-party advertisers. This tracking can lead to targeted phishing attacks and a breach of your personal privacy.</p>

    <h2>Protect Yourself on Public Wi-Fi:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a VPN to encrypt your data and protect your privacy. A VPN creates a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, making it difficult for attackers to intercept your data.</li>
        <li>Avoid accessing sensitive accounts like banking or email on public Wi-Fi. If possible, wait until you are on a secure, private connection.</li>
        <li>Ensure your device’s firewall and antivirus software are active and up to date. This helps protect against unauthorized access and malware infections.</li>
        <li>Turn off file sharing and disable automatic Wi-Fi connections. This reduces the risk of connecting to rogue hotspots and sharing your files without your knowledge.</li>
    </ul>
