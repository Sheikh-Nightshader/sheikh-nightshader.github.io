            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>With over a decade of hands-on experience in cybersecurity, I have developed a strong skill set in penetration testing, network security, and vulnerability assessment. My journey began with a keen interest in technology and coding, which has evolved into a full-fledged career focused on protecting digital assets.</p>
            <p>I am proficient in various programming languages, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Python</strong>: Used extensively for scripting, automation, and creating security tools.</li>
                <li><strong>PHP</strong>: Used for web applications, especially in understanding and securing server-side vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Perl</strong>: Leveraged for network programming and developing security scripts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My practical experience in penetration testing spans over a decade, during which I have conducted numerous assessments on various systems and networks, identifying vulnerabilities and providing actionable remediation strategies. I have worked with organizations of all sizes, from startups to established enterprises, to strengthen their security posture against evolving threats.</p>
            <p>I have developed a variety of tools specifically tailored for my own penetration testing efforts, as well as for use by other cybersecurity professionals. These tools are designed to tackle specific challenges in the field, enhancing the overall effectiveness of security assessments and aiding in the identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities.</p>
            <p>In addition to penetration testing, I have hands-on experience with Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and their mitigation. DoS attacks aim to make a service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from a single source, while DDoS attacks amplify this effect by using multiple compromised systems to launch coordinated assaults. Understanding the mechanics of both types of attacks has enabled me to effectively design and implement defense strategies for clients.</p>
            <p>To protect against DoS and DDoS attacks, I analyze potential threats and help organizations safeguard their infrastructure through measures like rate limiting, traffic filtering, and redundancy strategies. My goal is to ensure that businesses and users remain operational and secure, even in the face of potential disruptions.</p>
            <p>Throughout my career, I have developed expertise in using popular security tools such as Kali Linux, Metasploit, Burp Suite, and Wireshark. I specialize in performing comprehensive penetration tests that include web application testing, network security assessments, and social engineering exercises to evaluate an organization's overall security readiness.</p>
            <p>As a cybersecurity enthusiast, I actively engage in continuous learning and stay updated with the latest trends and techniques in the field. My goal is to promote awareness about online safety and the importance of cybersecurity, and I strive to share my knowledge through this platform. I also added a few tools to the site for you to play with and check your passwords or even legally apply a patch to a game rom.</p>
