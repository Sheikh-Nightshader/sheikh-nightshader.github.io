    <h1>What ISPs Can See</h1>
   
        <a href="index.html" class="button">Back</a>
    

    <h2>1. Browsing History</h2>
    <p>ISPs can track the websites you visit, including the URLs and the time spent on each site. This information can be logged and stored, potentially allowing ISPs to create a detailed profile of your online activities.</p>

    <h2>2. Connection Metadata</h2>
    <p>ISPs can see metadata related to your internet connections, including the times you connect and disconnect, the IP addresses you connect to, and the amount of data transferred. This data can be used to infer patterns about your internet usage.</p>

    <h2>3. Unencrypted Data</h2>
    <p>If you visit websites that do not use HTTPS encryption, ISPs can see the content of the data transmitted between your device and the server. This can include sensitive information, such as login credentials, personal messages, and credit card details.</p>

    <h2>4. DNS Queries</h2>
    <p>When you enter a website URL, your device makes a Domain Name System (DNS) request to translate that URL into an IP address. ISPs can see these DNS queries, revealing the domains you are trying to access, even if the actual content is encrypted.</p>

    <h2>5. Device and Application Usage</h2>
    <p>ISPs can identify the types of devices and applications you use based on the traffic patterns. For example, they can determine if you are streaming video, using social media, or engaging in online gaming, which helps them manage bandwidth and optimize their services.</p>

    <h2>6. Traffic Patterns</h2>
    <p>By analyzing the volume and type of data traffic, ISPs can detect unusual patterns that might indicate specific activities, such as peer-to-peer file sharing or potential security threats. This information can be used for throttling or prioritizing traffic.</p>

    <h2>7. Legal Requests</h2>
    <p>ISPs are legally obligated to comply with law enforcement requests for data. This means they can provide user data, browsing history, and other information to government agencies if required, often without the user's consent or knowledge.</p>

    <h2>Protecting Your Privacy from ISPs:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a VPN to encrypt your internet traffic, making it difficult for ISPs to monitor your online activities.</li>
        <li>Always use HTTPS websites to secure the data exchanged between your browser and the server.</li>
        <li>Regularly clear your browsing history and consider using privacy-focused search engines.</li>
        <li>Be aware of the data retention policies of your ISP and choose a provider that prioritizes user privacy.</li>
    </ul>
